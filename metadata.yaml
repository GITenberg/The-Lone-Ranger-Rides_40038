description: The lifeless bodies of Texas Rangers lay scattered on the floor of Bryant's
  Gap. One man, wounded and left for the buzzards, comes back to consciousness and
  vows to bring the killers to justice. Now known only as the Lone Ranger, this man,
  his steadfast horse, Silver, and trusted friend, Tonto, set out to bring justice
  to the men who ambushed him and his fellow rangers. With a 'Hi-Yo Silver, Away-y-y-y,'
  the Lone Ranger embodies classic American ideals of the champions of the Wild West.
  The Lone Ranger first found success as a 1933 radio show, then expanded into books,
  television, comics, and motion pictures. This iconic character has been portrayed
  George Seaton, Clayton Moore, and by Armie Hammer in the 2013 movie release The
  Lone Ranger (with Johnny Depp as Tonto). HarperPerennial Classics brings great works
  of literature to life in digital form, upholding the highest standards in ebook
  production and celebrating reading in all its forms. Look for more titles in the
  HarperPerennial Classics collection to build your digital library.
